#Welcome

This project is an attempt to make certain aspects of [Blender](http://www.blender.org/)'s interface more useable and discoverable. It was inspired by the [proposal](http://www.blenderguru.com/articles/new-blender-ui-proposal/) put forth by Andrew Price. He has a number of videos other than this one, describing the reasoning behind the proposal, which I'd recommend checking out as well. Within his proposal, the ribbon is obviously the biggest and most obvious change; and that's what I've tried to implement here. 

There are a lot of other suggestions which I've left out (for now), however I do intend to make a number of small tweaks to make certain interactions feel more native. If you'd like to have a go at making changes to this yourself, or if you can improve upon anything done here, grab the code and give it a go - I've documented some of my technical findings in a [wiki](https://github.com/wwestrop/blender/wiki).

(Note: currently only the first two tabs contain anything, the rest are "for demonstration purposes only")

The ribbon I've implemented is built on top of the existing framework in Blender. Popular implementations such as Microsoft's have a number of nice features, such as galleries, live previews, intelligent sizing, optional autohiding, context sensitive tabs; and is of course are backed up by hard data from their Customer Experience Improvement Program. In contrast this is a relatively simple tabbed icon bar, but still, I hope it helps to makes features discoverable, whereas currently some are accessible only via a keyboard shortcut. Context sensitivty may be somewhat do-able, but I need to do more research on this. 

See the [wiki](https://github.com/wwestrop/blender/wiki) for more details, particularly you may be interesed in [FAQ](https://github.com/wwestrop/blender/wiki/FAQ), and [customising the ribbon yourself](https://github.com/wwestrop/blender/wiki/Ribbon-customisation). I haven't got any binaries ready for distribution at this point, so you will have to build the code yourself. See [here](https://github.com/wwestrop/blender/wiki/Building-tips) for some pointers.
